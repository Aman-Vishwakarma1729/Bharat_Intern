# Bharat Internship Project

Welcome to my internship project completed during my time at Bharat Intern. This repository contains the implementation of two tasks: one involving a Machine Learning (ML) model for Titanic dataset classification and the other involving a Computer Vision model using the MNIST dataset for real-time number prediction.

## Overview

During my internship at Bharat Intern, I was assigned two tasks to demonstrate my skills in Machine Learning and Computer Vision:

1. **Titanic Dataset Classification:** In this task, I created a machine learning model using the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on certain features. The model was built using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas.

2. **Real-Time Number Prediction:** For the second task, I developed a computer vision model that uses the MNIST dataset. This model is capable of predicting handwritten digits in real-time using a webcam. The implementation involved Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.

## Tasks

### 1. Titanic Dataset Classification

- **Task Description:** Build a machine learning model to predict survival on the Titanic using passenger features.
- **Tools and Libraries:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas.
- **File:** `Titanic(1).ipynb`

### 2. Real-Time Number Prediction

- **Task Description:** Develop a computer vision model to predict handwritten digits in real-time using a webcam.
- **Tools and Libraries:** Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV.
- **File:** `CNN_LENET_Model_for_mnist_dataset.ipynb`




## Results

### Titanic Dataset Classification

After training and evaluating the model on the Titanic dataset, the achieved accuracy was XX%. You can find more details in the `Titanic(1).ipynb` notebook.

### Real-Time Number Prediction

The computer vision model for real-time number prediction achieved an accuracy of XX% on the MNIST dataset. A sample prediction can be seen below:
